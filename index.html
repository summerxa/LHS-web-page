        <h1>About Lynbrook High School</h1>

        <p>Hey check it out! It's a <a href="https://lhs.fuhsd.org/">link</a>!
            Lynbrook High School is pretty cool.
            You can't spell "school" without "choo", you know.</p>

        <p class="shhh">(Okay, look.
            I know my instructions were to make the website look good,
            and I just used Impact for the title,
            which is the antithesis of "looking good".
            But you see, the name "Impact" is symbolic as it represents
            the impact that Lynbrook students will have upon the world.
            Thus, my use of this unpleasant font is actually integral
            to the layout of this page.)</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, behold the pinnacle of graphic design, the wide Lynbrook:</p>
